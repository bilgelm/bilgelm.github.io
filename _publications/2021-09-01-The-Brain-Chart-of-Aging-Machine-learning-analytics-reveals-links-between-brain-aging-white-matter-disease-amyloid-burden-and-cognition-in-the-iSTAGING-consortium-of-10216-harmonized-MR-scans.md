### Abstract

**Introduction:** Relationships between brain atrophy patterns of typical aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), white matter disease, cognition, and AD neuropathology were investigated via machine learning in a large harmonized magnetic resonance imaging database (11 studies; 10,216 subjects).

**Methods:** Three brain signatures were calculated: Brain-age, AD-like neurodegeneration, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Brain Charts measured and displayed the relationships of these signatures to cognition and molecular biomarkers of AD.

**Results:** WMHs were associated with advanced brain aging, AD-like atrophy, poorer cognition, and AD neuropathology in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD and cognitively normal (CN) subjects. High WMH volume was associated with brain aging and cognitive decline occurring in an ≈10-year period in CN subjects. WMHs were associated with doubling the likelihood of amyloid beta (Aβ) positivity after age 65. Brain aging, AD-like atrophy, and WMHs were better predictors of cognition than chronological age in MCI/AD.

**Discussion:** A Brain Chart quantifying brain-aging trajectories was established, enabling the systematic evaluation of individuals' brain-aging patterns relative to this large consortium.
