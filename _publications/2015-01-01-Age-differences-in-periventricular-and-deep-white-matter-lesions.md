### Abstract

Deep white matter hyperintensity (DWMH) and periventricular (PV) white matter lesion volumes are associated with age and subsequent stroke. We studied age differences in these volumes accounting for collinearity and risk factors. Subjects were 563 healthy family members of early-onset coronary artery disease patients. Using 3T magnetic resonance imaging, lesions were classified as DWMH or PV. Age association with lesion classification was analyzed using random effects Tobit regression, adjusting for intracranial volume (ICV) and risk factors. Subjects were 60% women, 36% African-American, mean age 51 ± 11 years. In multivariable analysis adjusted for PV and ICV, DWMH was associated with age (p < 0.001) and female sex (p = 0.003). PV, adjusted for DWMH and ICV, was age associated (p < 0.001). For each age decade, DWMH showed 0.07 log units/decade greater volume (95% CI = 0.04–0.11); PV was 0.18 log units/decade greater (95% CI = 0.14–0.23); slope differences (p < 0.001). In people with a family history of coronary artery disease, PV and DWMH are independently and differentially associated with age controlling for traditional risk factors.
