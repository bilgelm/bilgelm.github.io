### Abstract

Surrogates of neuronal activity, typically measured by regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) or glucose metabolism, can be estimated from dynamic amyloid PET imaging. Using data for 149 participants (345 visits) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we assessed whether the average of early amyloid frames (EA) and <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> computed from dynamic <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET can serve as surrogates of rCBF computed from <sup>15</sup>O-H<sub>2</sub>O-PET. <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> had the highest longitudinal test–retest reliability. Interquartile range (IQR) of cross-sectional Pearson correlations with rCBF was 0.60–0.72 for EA and 0.63–0.72 for <i>R</i><sub>1</sub>. Correlations between rates of change were lower (IQR 0.22–0.50 for EA, 0.25–0.55 for <i>R</i><sub>1</sub>). Values in the Alzheimer’s metabolic signature meta-ROI were negatively associated with age and exhibited longitudinal declines for each PET measure. In age-adjusted analyses, meta-ROI rCBF and <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> were lower among amyloid+ individuals; EA and <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> were lower among males. Regional PiB-based measures, in particular <i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, can be suitable surrogates of rCBF. Dynamic PiB-PET may obviate the need for a separate scan to measure neuronal activity, thereby reducing patient burden, radioactivity exposure, and cost.
