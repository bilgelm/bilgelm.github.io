### Abstract

**INTRODUCTION:** Individualized estimates of age at detectable amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, distinct from amyloid positivity, allow for analysis of onset age of Aβ accumulation as an outcome measure to understand risk factors.

**METHODS:** Using longitudinal Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET data from Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we estimated the age at which each PiB+ individual began accumulating Aβ. We used survival analysis methods to quantify risk of accumulating Aβ and differences in onset age of Aβ accumulation in relation to *APOE* ε4 status and sex among 36 *APOE* ε4 carriers and 83 non-carriers.

**RESULTS:** Age at onset of Aβ accumulation for the *APOE* ε4− and ε4+ groups was 73.1 and 60.7, respectively. APOE ε4 positivity conferred a 3-fold risk of accumulating Aβ after adjusting for sex and education.

**DISCUSSION:** Estimation of onset age of amyloid accumulation may help gauge treatment efficacy in interventions to delay symptom onset in Alzheimer’s disease.
