My research focuses on understanding early brain changes in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease using neuroimaging methods, in particular, positron emission tomography (PET) scans of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. I am interested in quantifying the contribution of different neuropathologies to the propagation of brain changes among cognitively normal individuals, and ultimately, to cognitive decline. I design statistical models and methods for analyzing longitudinal neuroimaging data and other biomarkers as well as cognitive measures to enable progress towards this goal. I also apply tools from causal inference to quantify the direct contributions of neuropathology to downstream brain changes and cognition.

A major challenge in studying preclinical Alzheimer's disease is the extensive duration of this period and the limited longitudinal follow-up in existing observational studies. As a result, there is insufficient data at the individual level spanning the entire length of the preclinical period leading up to clinical presentation of disease. Statistical modeling, under certain assumptions, provides ways of leveraging short-term observations to obtain long-term trajectories.

The Disease Progression Score Model is a model that I have made [significant contributions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811916300349) to that allows for the delineation of the natural history of biomarkers and [cognitive measures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1552526014024170) implicated in Alzheimer's. This model can be used examine the temporal ordering of biomarkers, to determine a given individual’s disease stage based on a collection of longitudinal biomarker measurements, and to [predict future progression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352872919300077).

Another important aspect of the natural history of Alzheimer's is the onset of the major neuropathological hallmarks: amyloid and tau. I designed [a model to estimate the age at onset of amyloid changes at the individual level](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1552526015029106), and this work has been followed by [improved methods that have been applied to multiple cohorts](https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awac213/6646758). Estimated amyloid onset age can be used as an outcome in studies and potentially in clinical trials to assess the effects of risk factors and therapies in modulating the disease timeline.

I believe that such novel statistical methods will be critical for understanding the earliest changes leading to Alzheimer’s disease, enable the identification of strategies and time windows for therapeutic intervention, and allow for performing predictions at the individual level for disease progression and offer personalized prevention approaches.

I also design and implement streamlined workflows for 3D and 4D PET image processing and analysis.
